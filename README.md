# Computer Aided Detection in Mammography, Predictive classification for Breast Cancer
Computer Aided Diagnosis in Mammography is now an important topic of discussion due to advancement of technologies in both fields of obtaining the mammograms and analysing the mammograms. Digital mammography allows for more sophisticated analysing technologies such as machine learning to solve problems that arises from the variation of diagnosis of mammograms. This project explores the data processing methodologies used to feed data into different types of convolution neural networks (CNN).  The different neural networks are chosen as an experimentation to identify the efficiency between each network at classifying mammograms.
